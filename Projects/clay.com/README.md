Overview:

This project is a complete front-end clone of the Clay.com homepage, built purely with HTML and CSS.
It is part of my full-stack learning journey where I recreate real-world interfaces to improve layout skills, typography, responsiveness, and component structure.

Everything you see on the page is handcrafted, including:

Navigation bar

Hero section

Partner logo grid

Feature cards

Testimonials

Security badges

Full Clay-style footer with a background garden graphic

The design is recreated with attention to spacing, colors, and visual proportions.
